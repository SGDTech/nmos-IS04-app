# NMOS-IS04-PyApp

NMOS IS-04 python-based application.
The app is based on the AMWA NMOS-IS04 specification (https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-discovery-registration).

The Networked Media Open Specifications (NMOS) have been developed for use in IP-based infrastructures to provide a control and management layer in addition to the transport layer provided by SMPTE ST2110.  The goal is to provide a means for straightforward interoperability between products from a wide range of manufacturers, in order that end users and service providers can build best-of-breed systems.
